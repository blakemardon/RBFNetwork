<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is an implementation of a radial basis function network. This is a freeforward neural network that utilizes a basis function to approximate a desired output function. The method of training used in this network is backpropigation. The network was tested on data collected from the titanic describing passengers as well as if they survived or not. With this test data the network guesses whether a passenger will survive depending on attributes such as age and gender. The network currently is designed to work only as a RBF network but by changing the activation function other types of networks can also be achieved easily.

### Built With

* C#



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This project can be compiled using any C# compiler and requires no special configuration.


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Program.cs should be edited to point to the training data you wish to supply to the program as well as the testing set you would like to use to check the networks accuracy. Both sets of data should be in csv files.
